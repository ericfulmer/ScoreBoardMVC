The ScoreBoardProject is a javaFX app that implements a simple American Football scoreboard using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. Through the UI, users can enter the names of the home and away teams, record/update scoring events in real time, and use undo/clear functions when needed. The interface also displays the last action so anyone can understand what scoring event just took place. I have also added basic validation making sure that team names are set before scoring by showing a friendly alert on the screen isntead of allowing for invalid input

The MVC design is divided into three parts. The model (Scoreboard/ScoreChange) holds all business logic, including validation, scoring, undo history, and clearing the game, and it throws exceptions rather than using any JavaFX code. The view (FXML/CSS) was created using SceneBuilder and handles layout and styling only, and the controller connects all UI elements to model methods, update labels, and shows JavaFX alerts when invalid actions are attempted by the user. The app is launched through the App class, which loads the FXML and stylesheet. Compiling and running the program requires JavaFX modules on the module path (ex: --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml).

The model API includes methods to set team names, add points, undo scoring, clear the game, and return names, scores, and the last action. The ScoreboardTests class tests normal and errors cases printing pass/fail messages outside of the UI. Styling is handled through CSS, and the view is fully defined using SceneBuilder. Some limitations still remain like not having data persistence and no extra features like possession or quarter tracking, but the project showcases a complete implementation of the required MVC design, JavaFX FXML interface, CSS styling, input validation, undo functionality, and model testing.
